## Why was Kryptokrona Created?

**Kryptokrona** was created as an answer to the Swedish Riksbank commission of the centralized digital currency **E-krona** to further impose their control over Swedens native currency. 

The digital asset, **Kryptokrona**, was created without a pre-mine and without an initial coin offering to provide private trustless transactions.
